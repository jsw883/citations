          <p align="justify" class="no-bot-margined">Peter Salovey, Yale's 23rd President, was installed on Sunday, October 13, and following the ceremony Hillhouse Avenue was closed off for a massive Block Party with food, dancing, and of course singing! Following the procession, 11 of Yale's a cappella groups sang in the President with two of Yale's most famous fight songs, Boola-Boola and Bright College Years!</p>

          <p align="justify" class="no-bot-margined">We rehearse once a week on Wednesday nights for two hours, spending the time learning new songs and working on old ones! Andrea, our music director, does a wonderful job sorting out new arrangments to keep our repertoire diverse and interesting, making sure that we user our strengths and blend as a group, and actually running the rehearsal itself!</p>
